 *
 * Implementation of tactile feedback for the motion control glove
 * 
 * 1. Parameter Setup: Defines and initializes all of the necessary 
 *    variables for the glove.
 *
 * 2. Functions: Contains all of the user created functions to help process
 *    the signals and control the robot.
 *    - Calibrate
 *    - MoveMotor
 *
 * 3. Main Loop: First asks the user to calibrate the flex sensors to their
 *    hand by opening and closing their hand to get the max and min range.
 *    Takes in sensor measurements from the flex sensors and calls the 
 *    function to filter out the signal and then use the filtered value for
 *    the sensor measurement to move the Servo motor position.
 * 
 *    *** TO DO ***
 *     - Optimize code for speed.
 *     - Look at making a generic program for righ and left hand control.
 *     - Documentand comment all code clearly.
 *     - Make a status function for the 3 LEDs. {?}
 *     - Make an LED variable array for easy status definitions.
 *     - Look at naming convention for readings. {?}
 *     - Add thumb sensor for gripping motion.
